<blockquote>Apeirophobia is the irrational and excessive fear of infinity and the uncountable. It causes discomfort and sometimes panic attacks from intrusive thoughts of the infinity. It normally starts in adolescence, but in some rare cases, it can start before then. The origin of the word apeiro is Greek (meaning boundless or infinite) and phobia is Greek (meaning fear).</blockquote>
